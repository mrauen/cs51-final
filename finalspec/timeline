By April 21st:
•  Basic Dijkstra’s algorithm working
•	Fibonacci heap working
•	Most helper functions, global variables, events and brand infrastructure done
•	Participate in the iLab python web integration seminar (from 10am to 8pm on April 20th and 21st)
•	Finalize model for virtual edge confidence with relevant variables to be determined by machine learning algorithm
•	Write pseudocode algorithm for machine learning 

By April 28th:
•	Finish coding up machine learning algorithm (to get accurate confidence values for virtual edges)
•	Fix our modified implementation of Dijkstra’s and the Fibonacci heap to account for virtual edges
•	Write testing functions to test the entire project
•	Find accurate algorithm for recommending good-fit items
•	Write interface and pseudocode for recommending good-fit items

By May 5th:
•	Finish coding up extra feature (recommending good-fit items)
•	Test entire project
•	Finish integration into website
•	Hide some implementations from users
•	Test on real world application and adjust machine learning model and algorithm and Dijktra’s cutoff number of targets based on accuracy and speed
•	Test again and finalize
